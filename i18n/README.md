# Translations

The original [English version](https://github.com/dulcetti/format-masks) is the source of truth, as it is maintained and updated first.

All translations are created by and maintained by you, the community ;) .

1. [Portuguese-Brazil](https://github.com/dulcetti/format-masks/i18n/pt-BR.md) by [Bruno Dulcetti](https://github.com/dulcetti)
